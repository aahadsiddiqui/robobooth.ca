  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Can the print feature both our names and the engagement date?',
      answer: 'Yes — that\'s exactly what we design. Both names, the engagement date, and any additional personal touch you want (a short phrase, a heart motif, your wedding hashtag if you have one). We provide a design proof before the event.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we use the engagement party photos for our save-the-dates or announcements?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. The Gold and Platinum packages include professional photography with high-resolution files licensed for personal use, including save-the-dates, social announcements, and engagement photo albums.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can both families interact with the robot even if they\'ve never met before?',
      answer: 'That\'s actually one of our favorite outcomes. The robot is a natural icebreaker — it removes any awkwardness and gives two families who are meeting for the first time something fun to share immediately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if our engagement party is in a private home?',
      answer: 'We\'ve activated in private homes and residential settings many times. We assess the layout during our planning call and our operator navigates the space thoughtfully, avoiding any tight areas or fragile spots.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we book the same team for our wedding later?',
      answer: 'Yes, and many couples do. Booking your wedding with us after an engagement party activation secures your date and means your guests already know what to expect — which always builds anticipation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long in advance should we book?',
      answer: 'We recommend at least 3 weeks for design turnaround. Peak engagement season (spring and fall) books up quickly, so earlier is always better. Contact us with your date and we\'ll confirm availability immediately.',
