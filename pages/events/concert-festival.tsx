  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Can the robot operate in an outdoor festival environment?',
      answer: 'Yes. The robot is designed for outdoor and mixed-environment use. We operate in warm temperatures, on grass and gravel surfaces, and in ambient festival noise. We assess your specific venue setup during the planning call to confirm operational feasibility.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many photos can the robot capture in a 3-hour festival session?',
      answer: 'In high-volume mode at a festival, we typically capture 150–300+ photos per hour. Our throughput scales with crowd density — we optimize the activation flow to keep lines moving and energy high.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can sponsor logos be included in every photo?',
      answer: 'Yes — that\'s one of the primary value propositions for festival use. We integrate sponsor logos into the branded overlay on every photo. Multi-tier sponsor logo placement is available for Platinum activations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the photos be displayed on a live social wall at the festival?',
      answer: 'Yes, with our Platinum package. Photos captured by the robot feed to a real-time social wall integrated with your festival screens. It creates a live loop of guest content that drives even more engagement and sharing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you provide printed photos at festivals or just digital delivery?',
      answer: 'At festival scale, digital QR delivery is standard — it\'s faster, generates more sharing, and produces no physical waste. Printed outputs are available for smaller concerts or VIP activation zones where a premium physical keepsake adds value.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we track the social reach from the activation post-event?',
      answer: 'Yes. We can integrate a specific hashtag prompt into the QR delivery flow, making every share trackable by hashtag volume. We provide a post-event summary of captures, QR scans, and available social data for your sponsor reporting.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s your minimum lead time for a festival booking?',
      answer: 'We recommend 4–6 weeks minimum for festival activations to allow for branded overlay design, sponsor logo integration, and logistics coordination. For large-scale multi-day festivals, 8+ weeks is ideal.',
