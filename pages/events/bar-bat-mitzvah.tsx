    {
      question: 'Is the robot safe around kids and mixed-age groups?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. Our operators are experienced in environments with children and elderly guests. The robot moves slowly and deliberately, and our team manages interactions to ensure everyone — from toddlers to grandparents — has a comfortable and joyful experience.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we match the robot\'s print to our Mitzvah theme?',
      answer: 'Yes — that\'s our favorite kind of brief. Share your theme, color palette, and any design inspiration, and we\'ll build a custom print overlay that feels like part of the event design, not an afterthought.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the honoree\'s voice be programmed into the robot?',
      answer: 'Yes. We can record the honoree, their parents, or even a combination of both — a message that the robot delivers when it arrives at each table. It\'s consistently one of the biggest surprises and most emotional moments of the night.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the robot visit both the kids\' room and the main reception hall?',
      answer: 'With the Platinum package, yes — two stations means simultaneous coverage in multiple spaces. Alternatively, our operator can rotate between rooms during the session, though we\'ll discuss timing to make sure the coverage makes sense for your layout.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many tables can the robot visit in a typical session?',
      answer: 'In 2 hours, we typically visit 15–25 tables. Larger receptions over 150 guests benefit from a 3–4 hour extended session or the Platinum package with a second station.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you have experience at Jewish events and traditional venues?',
      answer: 'Yes. We\'ve worked at numerous Bar and Bat Mitzvahs at banquet halls, synagogue reception rooms, hotel ballrooms, and private venues across the USA. We\'re familiar with the typical reception flow — cocktail hour, dinner, hora, candle lighting, dancing — and we schedule the robot to complement it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the prints be used in a Mitzvah memory book or scrapbook?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. The prints are high-quality photo prints designed to be kept. Many families include robot photos alongside professional photos in the official Mitzvah memory book — they add personality and humor to balance the formal portraits.',
