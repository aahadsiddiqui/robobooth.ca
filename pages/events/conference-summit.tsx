    {
      name: 'Ryan C.',
      role: 'Conference Director, Industry Association',
      text: 'Our delegates were posting LinkedIn content during the networking break — before we even announced the afternoon sessions. Our conference hashtag trended organically for the first time in the event\'s history. The robot was the single most talked-about element of the day.',

      name: 'Anika S.',
      role: 'Head of Events, Financial Services Firm',
      text: 'We used the photo overlay to feature our two headline sponsors. Both sponsors noted it in their post-event reports as a standout deliverable. It\'s now a premium item in our sponsorship packages — and it actually sells. Our attendees love it too.',

      name: 'Thomas B.',
      role: 'Summit Organiser, Tech Industry',
      text: 'I was worried the robot would feel gimmicky for a professional audience. The opposite happened — senior executives and C-suite attendees were the most engaged. The networking energy it created in the break zones was something we\'ve never achieved before with any other activation.',

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Can the photo overlay include all of our event sponsors?',
      answer: 'Yes. We can include all sponsor logos in the overlay, arranged by tier if needed. Many conference organisers offer "branded photo sponsor" as a premium package item to their sponsors — it\'s a tangible, measurable deliverable that sponsors genuinely value.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the robot work for a formal or professional conference environment?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. The robot\'s branding, voice lines, and overall aesthetic are fully customisable to match the tone of your event — whether that\'s a high-energy tech summit or a formal financial services conference. We calibrate the activation to your audience.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the robot handle high-density networking sessions with hundreds of delegates?',
      answer: 'The robot is designed for high-traffic environments. Our operator guides it to maximise engagement throughout your networking zones, ensuring it reaches as many delegates as possible. For very large conferences, additional activation stations in the Platinum Package extend coverage across your full venue.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we use the activation across a two-day or multi-day summit?',
      answer: 'Yes. Multi-day bookings are available. We can maintain consistent branding across all days, or refresh the overlay and voice messaging between days to reflect different themes, speakers, or sponsors. Contact us for multi-day pricing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if we need to reschedule due to low registration or venue changes?',
      answer: 'We understand that conference logistics can change. Reach out to us as early as possible if you need to reschedule and we\'ll do our best to accommodate your new date. Our team works with you throughout the planning process to ensure flexibility wherever possible.',
