  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Will the robot disrupt speeches or award presentations?',
      answer: 'Never. Our operator is trained to pause table visits during speeches, presentations, and award announcements. We work around your program schedule — just share your run-of-show and we coordinate accordingly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we customize the print design to match our gala\'s formal theme?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. We design a custom print overlay for every event — gold foil aesthetics, your corporate crest, award category text, whatever your brand guide requires. We share a proof before the event for your approval.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the robot handle large round tables?',
      answer: 'The robot is designed for social environments. Our operator positions it at each table and encourages the full table to gather for group photos. Most tables end up with 8–10 people in the frame — it becomes a shared moment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can award winners get a special print?',
      answer: 'Yes. We can set up a dedicated winner\'s frame so each award recipient gets a uniquely branded print noting their award category and the evening\'s date. It becomes a trophy in its own right.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s your minimum booking window for a gala?',
      answer: 'We recommend booking at least 3–4 weeks in advance for galas so we have time to design and approve your print overlay. For large galas over 300 guests, 6 weeks is ideal. That said, contact us for last-minute availability — we occasionally have openings.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with hotel ballrooms and formal venues?',
      answer: 'Yes — Hilton, Marriott, Ritz, Four Seasons, and virtually every major Chicago-area banquet and hotel venue. We coordinate load-in with venue staff and operate within all noise and equipment policies.',
