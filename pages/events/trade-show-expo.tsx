  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Do I need to get approval from the show organiser before booking?',
      answer: 'This depends on the specific show and venue. Many trade shows welcome interactive activations and the robot is entirely self-contained with no power or WiFi requirements. We recommend checking with your show organiser early — and we can provide documentation about the activation on request to support your approval process.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the robot operate outside of our assigned booth footprint?',
      answer: 'In some shows, yes — the roaming floor mode allows the robot to move beyond your booth perimeter and direct floor traffic back to your stand. This requires prior approval from show management. Our team can advise on how to request this and what parameters are typically permitted.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the photo lead capture work?',
      answer: 'When attendees receive their photo via SMS, their phone number is logged. This creates a contact list of everyone who engaged with your booth activation. Depending on your configuration and local privacy laws, you can incorporate opt-in messaging for follow-up marketing. We advise on compliant implementation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the robot\'s messaging be updated between show days?',
      answer: 'Yes. If your show runs multiple days, we can update voice lines or overlay messaging between days to promote different products, announce a daily show special, or refresh the experience for repeat visitors. This is particularly effective for longer expo runs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the minimum booth size required for the robot to operate effectively?',
      answer: 'The robot can work in booths as small as a standard 10x10 inline space. For smaller booths, it can operate primarily within your booth footprint. For larger island or peninsula booths, it roams the perimeter and draws attention from a wider area. Our team will assess your specific booth layout during the planning process.',
