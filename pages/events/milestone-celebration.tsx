    {
      question: 'Can we feature the honoree\'s photo or a specific milestone message on the prints?',
      answer: 'Yes. We can incorporate a photo of the honoree, a milestone quote, their name, and the date into a custom-designed print overlay. We share a proof before the event and refine it until it\'s perfect.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What kinds of milestone events do you typically cover?',
      answer: 'We cover all major personal milestones: milestone birthdays (40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th), wedding anniversaries, retirement parties, and combined celebration events. If it\'s a milestone worth marking, we\'re the right fit.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the robot say something personal when it arrives at a table?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. We can program a custom voice message into the robot — a greeting from the honoree, a message from a family member, or a fun inside reference that only the guests would understand. It\'s always a crowd-pleaser.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the robot work in a backyard or outdoor venue?',
      answer: 'Yes, with some weather considerations. Covered outdoor spaces (tents, patios with overhang) work well. We\'ll discuss your specific venue setup during the planning call to ensure everything runs smoothly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many guests can the robot capture in a 2-hour window?',
      answer: 'In a 2-hour session, we typically visit 15–25 tables and capture 60–120 individual photos. For parties over 100 guests, we recommend a 3-hour session or the Gold/Platinum package with extended time.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we get a digital gallery to share with family who couldn\'t attend?',
      answer: 'Yes — all photos are captured digitally and accessible via QR code immediately. We also compile a private digital gallery link you can share with anyone, including family members who attended remotely.',
