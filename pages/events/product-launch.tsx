  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How far in advance should I book for a product launch?',
      answer: 'We recommend booking at least 4–6 weeks in advance to allow enough time for custom overlay design, voice line scripting, and brand approval. For major launches, 8+ weeks is ideal. That said, if your launch date is sooner, contact us — we may be able to accommodate rush bookings.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the photo overlay match our exact campaign artwork and brand guidelines?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. Our design team works from your brand kit, campaign assets, and product packaging to create overlays that look like they came straight from your marketing department. We share a proof before the event and make revisions until it\'s exactly right.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the custom voice lines and how do they work?',
      answer: 'The robot announces a scripted message with every photo capture — your product name, a campaign slogan, or a launch tagline. You provide the script, we program and test it before the event. It\'s one of the biggest crowd moments of the night.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the robot need WiFi or a power outlet to operate?',
      answer: 'No. The robot is fully self-contained — it operates on battery and delivers photos to guest phones via its own data connection. Your venue doesn\'t need to provide anything. This also means it can roam freely without being tethered to any location.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we use the photos from the event in our marketing campaigns?',
      answer: 'Yes. All photos captured during your event belong to you with full usage rights. Many of our clients repurpose launch-night content in social media ads, email campaigns, press releases, and sales decks. The Gold and Platinum packages also include professional photography for even more campaign-ready assets.',
