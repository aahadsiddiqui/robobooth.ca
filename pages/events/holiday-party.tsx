  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What size holiday party does this work for?',
      answer: 'We\'ve done parties from 20 people to 500+. For groups under 100, a single robot and 2-hour session is usually perfect. For larger parties or longer events, we recommend the Gold or Platinum package with extended hours and a second station.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you operate in a restaurant private dining room?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. Restaurant buyouts and private dining rooms are some of our most common venues. The robot is compact and maneuverable — it navigates through tables without disturbing service or other diners.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How far in advance should we book for December?',
      answer: 'December fills up faster than any other month. We strongly recommend booking by October. November bookings are possible but risky — we regularly turn away December requests after mid-November.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we include a message from our CEO on the prints?',
      answer: 'Yes — we can add a short thank-you message, a holiday greeting, or even a year-in-review tagline to the print overlay. Just share the copy and we\'ll integrate it into the design.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the robot work in a dim/ambient-lit venue?',
      answer: 'Yes. Our robot has its own lighting system built in, so ambient or low-light venues are not a problem. The photos come out crisp and well-lit regardless of the room\'s lighting setup.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the photos be used in company communications?',
      answer: 'Yes — with the Gold and Platinum packages, all images are licensed for internal use including newsletters, intranets, LinkedIn posts, and company social media.',
